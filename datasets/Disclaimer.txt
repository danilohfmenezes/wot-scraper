Some characters don't have Bio info. I have found two of them. Two other I was not able to find:
https://wot.fandom.com/wiki/Culan_Cuhan
https://wot.fandom.com/wiki/Anla_the_Wise_Counselor

Had to Clean some Character By Hand after collection. Basically the wiki had some data problems with data inserted, I actually corrected some so maybe if 
the scraper is run again it will get the correct data this time.
Rosel (first mentioned)
Martna (first mention, last appeared)
Sandip (first appeared)
Mistress Asher (first appeared, last appeared)
Ronja (First appeared, last appeared)

The POV statistics dataset was scraped but one line was altered:
Line 35 resulted in Prologue. I changed it manually so that it could corresponde to the way the second prologue is referred to in the wiki page.
