Some characters don't have Bio info. I have found two of them. Two other I was not able to find:

Had to Clean some Character By Hand after collection. The reason is the white separator, which differs from the one I used. Feel free to change the spider to capture it better and open a pull request.

Some characters have the same name but are different characters, as I scraped from the Bio info in the character page the scraper could not capture the specifier. I found those characters using pandas and filled the complement myself. Feel free to change the spider to capture it better and open a pull request.

The POV statistics dataset was scraped but one line was altered:
Line 35 resulted in Prologue. I changed it manually so that it could corresponde to the way the second prologue is referred to in the wiki page.
